BarBay.jl is a Julia package for performing Bayesian inference of relative fitness from high-throughput barcode sequencing data. The package implements robust statistical models to analyze competitive fitness assays and estimate relative fitness values with quantified uncertainty.

## Features

- ðŸ§¬ Analyze barcode sequencing data from competitive fitness assays
- ðŸ“Š Support for multiple experimental designs:
    - Single condition experiments
    - Multiple experimental replicates
    - Multiple environmental conditions
    - Multiple genotype groupings
- ðŸ“ˆ Bayesian inference using:
    - Variational inference with ADVI
- ðŸŽ¯ Built-in support for:
    - Population mean fitness estimation
    - Mutant fitness effects
    - Hierarchical models for replicates and genotypes
    - Environment-specific fitness effects

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("BarBay")
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of analyzing fitness data from a single condition
experiment:

```julia
using BarBay
using CSV
using DataFrames

# Load your data (must be in tidy format)
data = DataFrame(
    :barcode => [...],    # Barcode identifiers
    :time => [...],       # Time points
    :count => [...],      # Raw counts
    :neutral => [...]     # Boolean indicating neutral lineages
)

# Run Bayesian inference using ADVI
results = BarBay.vi.advi(
    data = data,
    model = BarBay.model.fitness_normal,  # Basic fitness model
    outputname = "fitness_results"        # Optional: save to CSV
)

# The results DataFrame contains posterior distributions for:
# - Population mean fitness
# - Individual mutant fitness effects
# - Associated uncertainty measurements
```

For more complex experimental designs:

```julia
# Multiple replicates
results = BarBay.vi.advi(
    data = data,
    model = BarBay.model.replicate_fitness_normal,
    rep_col = :replicate  # Column indicating replicates
)

# Multiple environments
results = BarBay.vi.advi(
    data = data,
    model = BarBay.model.multienv_fitness_normal,
    env_col = :environment  # Column indicating environments
)

# Multiple genotypes
results = BarBay.vi.advi(
    data = data,
    model = BarBay.model.genotype_fitness_normal,
    genotype_col = :genotype  # Column indicating genotypes
)
```
