    freq_lognormal(R̲̲⁽ⁿ⁾, R̲̲⁽ᵐ⁾, R̲̲, n̲ₜ; λ_prior)

`Turing.jl` model to sample the joint posterior distribution for frequency
values on a fitness experiment.

# Model
`[write model here]`

# Arguments
- `R̲̲::Matrix{Int64}`:: `T × B` matrix--split into a vector of vectors
  for computational efficiency--where `T` is the number of time points in the
  data set and `B` is the number of barcodes. Each column represents the barcode
  count trajectory for a single lineage. **NOTE**: This matrix does not
  necessarily need to be equivalent to `hcat(R̲̲⁽ⁿ⁾, R̲̲⁽ᵐ⁾)`. This is because
  `R̲̲⁽ᵐ⁾` can exclude mutant barcodes to perform the joint inference only for a
  subgroup, but `R̲̲` must still contain all counts. Usually, if `R̲̲⁽ᵐ⁾`
  excludes mutant barcodes, `R̲̲` must be of the form `hcat(R̲̲⁽ⁿ⁾, R̲̲⁽ᵐ⁾,
  R̲̲⁽ᴹ⁾)`, where `R̲̲⁽ᴹ⁾` is a vector that aggregates all excluded mutant
  barcodes into a "super barcode."
- `n̲ₜ::Vector{Int64}`: Vector with the total number of barcode counts for each
  time point. **NOTE**: This vector **must** be equivalent to computing
  `vec(sum(R̲̲, dims=2))`. The reason it is an independent input parameter is to
  avoid the `sum` computation within the `Turing` model.
- `n_neutral::Int`: Number of neutral lineages in dataset. **NOTE** This
  argument is irrelevant for this function. It is only included to have
  consistent inputs across models.
- `n_bc::Int`: Number of mutant lineages in datset. **NOTE** This argument is
  irrelevant for this function. It is only included to have consistent inputs
  across models.

## Optional Keyword Arguments
- `λ_prior::Vector{Float64}=[3.0, 3.0]`: Vector with the corresponding
  parameters (`λ_prior[1]` = mean, `λ_prior[2]` = standard deviation) for a
  Log-Normal prior on the λ parameter in the Poisson distribution. The λ
  parameter can be interpreted as the mean number of barcode counts since we
  assume any barcode count `n⁽ᵇ⁾ ~ Poisson(λ⁽ᵇ⁾)`. **NOTE**: This method assigns
    the same prior to **all** mutant fitness error values to be inferred.
